## Random Password Generator

## Description
This is a random password generator. When you click on the Generate Password button the program prompts you with 5 questions; Choose the length you want for your password, would you like to include uppercase letters, would you like to include lowercase letters, would you like to include special characters, and would you like to include numbers. Once the user has successfully answered all these questions the program creates an array containing only those characters that the user has said yes to. Once the function gets set in motion it will iterate through this array and randomly pick out characters for your password. Once this function has completed it will display your password on the screen.
